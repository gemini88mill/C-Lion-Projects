The downtown movie theater, which serves food during their movies, is running a special for
large groups. Any group that buys 10 or more movie tickets can buy slices of pizza for $1 each.
Normally, slices are $2 each. Note that movie tickets cost $10 each. Since the movie theater's
cash register is having some trouble ringing up this special, they've asked you to write a small
program to calculate the total cost for each group buying tickets and pizza.

The Problem
Given the number of movie tickets and slices of pizza a group wants to buy, determine their total
cost, in dollars.

The Input
The first line of the input file will contain a single positive integer, n (n ≤ 1000), representing the
number of test cases to process. Each of the test cases will follow, one per line. Each test case
will have two space separated positive integers, m (m ≤ 1000) and p (p ≤ 10000), representing
the number of movie tickets and number of slices of pizza bought by the corresponding group.

The Output
Output a single integer on a line by itself for each test case indicating the cost for the
corresponding group, in dollars.
